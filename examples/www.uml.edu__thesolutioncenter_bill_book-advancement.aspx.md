## Bookstore Advancements (formerly known as Bookstore Vouchers)

Your anticipated financial aid package must exceed your financial obligation to the university for the current semester in order to qualify for the bookstore advancement program. The advancement is an available line of credit at theUMass Lowell River Hawk Shopto be used for textbooks and course related supplies. Bookstore마dvancements may vary from as little at $50 to up to $700.

## If you qualify for a bookstore마dvancement, you will receive an email in your university student email account마nd it will be noted in SiS student center to do list.

The email sent to you will provide the dates in which the마dvancement망ill be valid. There will be no extensions. To take advantage of your마dvancement, simply visit the River Hawk Shop located in University Crossing. For hours of operation, pleasevisit the bookstore website.

You must present a picture ID to use your마dvancement. If you are an online student, you can order books from theUMass Lowell Bookstoreusing your마dvancement마s method of payment and have your books shipped to you.

Using a막ookstore마dvancement맋oes not change the total of your financial aid award. It is not an additional award. A bookstore마dvancement말s simply a way to access your financial aid for bookstore purchases. The exact amount you charge at the bookstore will be added to your SiS account. Your financial aid will be applied towards these charges and the balance will be deducted from your financial aid refund, should you qualify.If you opt not to use your마dvancement맟ou do not need to do anything. If you do not use the마dvancement, your account will not be charged.

If your financial aid package changes for any reason (i.e.: declining a portion of your financial aid package), you are still responsible for all charges incurred at the bookstore.

Note: If loans are part of your financial aid package and you will be declining the loans, please call The Solution Center at 978-934-2000 to verify that you still qualify for a bookstore마dvancement. Students who withdraw may return books in good condition with a receipt to the bookstore. VisitBook Return Policyfor more information.

If your financial aid/loans are reduced for any reason, you must personally accept full responsibility for all charges made to the bookstore. Failure to repay the university in full may result in withholding the university services and/or ability to register for the upcoming semester. Outstanding obligations will be referred to a collection agency and the student assumes liability for all associated collection costs.
